	<p1>About<br></p1>
	<p2>
		Rise Against is an American punk rock band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1999. The band's current line-up<br>
		comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist Tim McIlrath, lead guitarist Zach Blair, bassist Joe Principe and drummer<br>
		Brandon Barnes. Former members are guitarists Dan Wleklinski, Kevin White, Todd Mohney and Chris Chasse, and drummer <br>
		Toni Tintari.<br>
		The band spent its first four years signed to the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords, on which they released<br>
		two studio albums, The Unraveling (2001) and Revolutions per Minute (2003). Both the albums met with considerable<br>
		underground success, and in 2003 the band signed with the major label Geffen. Their major label debut Siren Song of<br>
		the Counter Culture (2004) brought the band mainstream success, producing several successful singles. Their next two<br>
		albums, The Sufferer & the Witness (2006) and Appeal to Reason (2008), were also successful and peaked at number ten<br>
		and number three on the Billboard 200 chart, respectively. Appeal to Reason was followed three years later by Endgame<br>
		(2011). All four albums released via Geffen were certified platinum in Canada, while three of these albums were<br>
		certified gold in the United States.<br>
		Rise Against is also known for their advocacy of progressivism, supporting organizations such as Amnesty International<br>
		and the It Gets Better Project. The band actively promotes animal rights and most of the members are straight edge<br>
		(excluding Barnes), PETA supporters and vegetarians.
